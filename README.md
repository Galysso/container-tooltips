# Container Tooltips

Shows the contents of a container when you look at it without having to open it.

Are you tired of constantly opening and re-opening chests because you don't remember what you put in them? Are you tired of farming cows for leather, so you can make item frames? This is a mod for you.

This mod does to in-world containers what [Shulker Box Tooltips](https://modrinth.com/mod/shulkerboxtooltip) does for shulker boxes in your inventory.

This mod needs to be installed to both the client and the server because Minecraft client does not save container contents locally when they are not open.
